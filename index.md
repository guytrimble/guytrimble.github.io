I am a computer science major at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 9, part 1

 This was my favorite lab because I learned the most and it was the most challenging for me. In this lab I practiced how to read from and write to a file. I learned about filed input and output streams. I also practiced using the push back function.

* Lab 6, part 2

 This was my second favorite lab. This is because it involved writing code that made it possible to play blackjack. I enjoy playing blackjack for fun in real life, so it was fun to be able to create from scratch a game that I like to play.

* Lab 8, part 2

 This was my third favorite lab because it involved using nested for loops to create a pattern. It was very fun to see the logic I thought of in my head appear on the screen because of the code I wrote. It was fun.
